Special Cases & Additional Considerations:
Mixed Sentiment: If the sentence contains both positive and negative emotions, classify based on the dominant sentiment. Example:
Input: "The app's interface is great, but the voice recognition is terrible." → Negative
Sarcasm & Irony: If the statement implies the opposite of its literal meaning, classify based on intent.
Input: "Oh great, another error. Just what I needed!" → Frustrated
Unclear or Ambiguous Statements: If the sentiment is unclear, default to Neutral unless context suggests otherwise.
